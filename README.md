# Olympic-database
cpsc 304 project done by Bryan, Jenny, Joyce

## Project Description
The domain we will model is the Olympics, and the data stored will focus on aspects of an Olympics event.

This database application will provide the Olympic Committee with the data of all that is involved in hosting an Olympic event, thus it will help them to record and organize the event. The database will contain information about each aspect of the represented Olympic event, ranging from the different sports and its corresponding events, to the contestants, referees, and volunteers that will organize and participate in these events. 

The database will have two classes of users: The Olympic officials and volunteers, and audiences. The database will be accessible by everyone, but some parts of the database will be restricted and only available to Olympic officials and volunteers. For instance, Olympic officials and volunteers will have access to lookup who volunteers or is in charge of setting up the event while people who are not associated with the Olympics(eg. the audience) would only have access to lookup the events that are played and the teams that participate in them.

The project will be implemented using the Oracle Database System from the CPSC department and Java/JDBC.
